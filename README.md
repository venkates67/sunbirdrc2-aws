# Production deployment using Helm charts
The below scripts will help the adopters to deploy SunbirdRC services in kubernetes environment.

## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes Cluster with minimum 3 nodes
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- kubectl
- Ingress
- Postgres DB (create database for `keycloak` and `registry`)
- ElasticSearch (Optional)
- Kafka (Optional)
- Redis (Optional)
- Minio (Optional)
- Domain URL (domain url mapped to kubernetes cluster)

The above optional services are not mandatory for SunbirdRC services. It can be installed based on the requirement on the project. For more details https://docs.sunbirdrc.dev/learn/readme-1/high-level-architecture

## Deployment steps

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sunbird-RC/sunbird-rc-core.git
cd infra
```

### Pre check
Make sure from the current directory you're able to run the below commands
```bash
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get ns
helm version
```

### Create namespace
```bash
kubectl create ns demo-registry
```
`Feel free to use a different name for the namespace. Use the same name in the reset of the commands.`

## Vault Deployment 

We use hashicorp vault as the keystore (for ore details you can refer here : https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault )

You can refer to this offical documentation for healm based deployment on a kubernetes cluster. This deployment guide covers the steps required to install and configure a single HashiCorp Vault cluster.(https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-raft-deployment-guide )


- Please follow the steps to deploy the vault service. _And use the same namespace that you have created in the previous step_.  
- Unsealing a Vault is a critical process that involves reconstructing the master key from multiple key shares. This process is designed to provide added security.

### Here are the basic steps to unseal a HashiCorp Vault:

- Initialization (First-time setup):
If you are initializing Vault for the first time, you'll need to run the following command to initialize the Vault and obtain unseal keys and the initial root token:

```bash
vault operator init
```
The output will provide unseal keys and an initial root token(<root_token>). Keep this information secure. (**Make sure to have a copy of these keys or store it in a key.txt file securley**)

make sure to use the <root_token> in the values.yaml.(VAULT_SECRET_TOKEN : base64 format of this <root_token>) 

Unsealing:
When Vault starts, it is sealed, and you need to unseal it using the unseal keys. You can unseal the Vault with the following command:

```bash
vault operator unseal
```

You will be prompted to enter an unseal key. Repeat this process with multiple unseal keys until the required threshold is reached.

Access Vault:
After unsealing, you can access Vault using the initial root token or other tokens with appropriate permissions.

```bash
vault login <root_token>
```
Replace <root_token> with the initial root token obtained during the initialization.

Remember that unsealing requires a specified threshold (generally 3 ) of key shares to be provided, typically set during initialization. It's a security measure to ensure that a single compromised key is not enough to unseal the Vault.

- Once you have the keys secured. You have to enable a KV engine 

## Enable KV Engine in vault :
Use the vault secrets enable command to enable a KV engine. In this example, we're enabling the KV version 2 engine. You can replace secret-v2 with any path you prefer.
```bash
vault secrets enable -path=kv kv-v2
```
This command enables the KV version 2 secrets engine at the specified path (kv). You can choose a different path based on your requirements. (But what ever name you provide here has to be use as the root_path: http://vault:8200/v1/kv in the values.yaml)


### Create secrets
Convert all the passwords/secrets into base64 format and update these values in `values.yaml` file
**Secrets**
- DB_PASSWORD: Postgres database password
- KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD: Keycloak admin password used to login to admin console
- KEYCLOAK_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD: Default password to be set for new users created by registry
- MINIO_SECRET_KEY: Minio secret key 
- ELASTIC_SEARCH_PASSWORD: Elastic search connection password
- KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET: Client secret of keycloak admin client for registry
- VAULT_SECRET_TOKEN: Initial Root Token that you get when you deploy vault service (ex : hvs.*************)
- DB_URL: Database Connection URL with username and password (Example: postgres://{{databse_usename}}:{{database_password}}@localhost:5432/{{database_name:sunbirdrc}})

`VAULT_SECRET_TOKEN, DB_URL, DB_PASSWORD, KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD and KEYCLOAK_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD are mandotry secrets to be set. Other secrets can be set to empty `

### Modify configuration values
Configuration values like database address, elastic search address etc should be modified in values.yaml file.


### Schemas
All schema files should be placed in the schemas directory located at `sunbird-rc-core/infra/helm_charts/charts/registry/schemas`.

### Configure signing keys
The signing keys should be placed in the below directories

Both public and private keys for signing

`sunbird-rc-core/infra/helm_charts/charts/certificate-signer/keys`

Only public key for exposing to verifiers

`sunbird-rc-core/infra/helm_charts/charts/public-key-service/keys`
# Please note that by default a sample key is added. It is highly recommended to update this key before going to production.

### Deploy helm charts
```bash
helm upgrade --install --namespace=demo-registry demo-registry helm_charts --create-namespace
```
**Output**
```
Release "demo-registry" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: demo-registry
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu May  4 17:02:08 2023
NAMESPACE: demo-registry
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
```

**Check if all the pods are running**
```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo-registry
```

### Import keycloak realm

- Goto keycloak admin console `<host>/auth/`
- Login with username `admin` and use the same password configured in secrets
- Click on `Master` and select `Add realm`
- Select `https://github.com/Sunbird-RC/sunbird-rc-core/blob/main/imports/realm-export.json` file 
- And click on `Create`


### Configure keycloak secret

**Get keycloak secret from keycloak admin console**
- Goto keycloak admin console `<host>/auth/`
- Login with username `admin` and use the same password configured in secrets
- Goto `clients` page and click on `admin-api`
- Goto `Credentials` tab and click on `Regenerate Secret`
- Copy the secret

**Configure secret in registry**
- Get all secrets created
```bash
kubectl get secret -n demo-registry
```
- Encode the secret in base64 format
```bash
echo -n "secret copied from keycloak" | base64
```
- Open the secret in edit mode
```bash
kubectl edit secret rc-secret -n demo-registry
```
Replace empty string for `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET` with the base64 encoded secret
- Restart registry
```bash
kubectl rollout restart deploy/demo-registry -n demo-registry
```
- Check the pods status
```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo-registry
```

### Check registry apis
Open the below url in browser and check if you're able to get the swagger json
`<host>/registry/api/docs/swagger.json`
